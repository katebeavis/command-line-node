# Command Line Badge Finder
Command Line Badge Finder is a Node.js app that takes usernames of Treehouse members as an argument and returns the total number of their badges, Javascript points and total points, by making an api call to Treehouse.

I did this project in order to get a firm understanding of the basics of Node.js and how it differs from other frameworks such as Sinatra.
